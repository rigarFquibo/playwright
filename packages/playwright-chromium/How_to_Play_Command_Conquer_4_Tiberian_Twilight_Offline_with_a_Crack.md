## Overview of Command & Conquer 4 Tiberian Twilight
 
Command & Conquer 4 Tiberian Twilight is the final installment in the Tiberium saga of the Command & Conquer series. It was released in 2010 by EA Los Angeles and Victory Games. The game is set in the year 2062, when the world is on the brink of extinction due to the spread of the alien substance Tiberium. The game features two factions: the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod, who have formed an uneasy alliance to stop the Tiberium threat and a mysterious alien force known as the Scrin.
 
## Gameplay Features
 
Command & Conquer 4 Tiberian Twilight differs from previous games in the series in several ways. The game does not have base building or resource gathering, instead focusing on mobile warfare with a crawler that acts as a mobile base. The game also introduces a class system, with three classes for each faction: offense, defense, and support. Each class has its own units, abilities, and upgrades. The game also has a persistent online progression system that unlocks new units and upgrades as the player levels up.
 
## Campaign and Multiplayer Modes
 
The game has two campaigns, one for each faction, that can be played solo or cooperatively with another player. The campaigns consist of 14 missions each, with branching paths and multiple objectives. The game also has a multiplayer mode that supports up to 10 players in 5v5 matches. The multiplayer mode has two modes: domination and capture the flag. In domination, players have to capture and hold control nodes on the map to earn points. In capture the flag, players have to steal and return the enemy's flag to their base.
